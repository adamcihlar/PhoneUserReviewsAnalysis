- [ ] Clean the code and structure
  - [ ] create main.py
  - [ ] turn the spaghetti to functions (especially in model.py)
2. [ ] Improve the model - 50-60 % on validation set is not the best
  * [ ] try out a model pretrained for sentiment - number of classes?
  * [ ] larger model (tiny-bert might be too small?)
  * [ ] convert reviews to positive x negative, then pretrained sentiment model
3. [ ] Seperate WordClouds for classes (/positive and negative reviews)
4. [ ] Get embeddings from the classifier - project to lower dim space (PCA?), color based on Ratings, clustering, main topics for the created clusters
